Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow currently working with the [Ethical Intelligence Lab](https://www.juliandefreitas.com/) in the [Marketing Unit](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/units/marketing/Pages/default.aspx/) at [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx/). In 2021 I was a postdoctoral fellow in Transportation Engineering at the University of Toronto in Canada. I received my PhD in Software Engineering from University of Calgary in Canada, following my MSc and BSc in Transportation Engineering and Civil Engineering in Iran. 


My research centers on intelligent transportation systems, autonomous machines, public health, and social media analysis.
