Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow currently working with the [Ethical Intelligence Lab](https://www.juliandefreitas.com/) at [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx/). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Transportation Engineering at the University of Toronto in Canada. I received my PhD in Software Engineering from University of Calgary in Canada. Also, I completed my MSc and BSc degrees in Transportation Engineering and Civil Engineering in Iran. 


My research centres on intelligent transportation systems, autonomous machines, public health, and social media analysis.
